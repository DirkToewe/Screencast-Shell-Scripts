# Screencast-Shell-Scripts
There are many GUI-Based Screencast programs for Linux and Windows. But they always left me unsatisified. They either turned out to be slow or the microphone couldn't be recorded separately.

In the end I turned to LibAV and the ```avconv``` command. Despite the [good documentation](https://libav.org/avconv.html) of the different ```avconv``` arguments, it is quite hard to put all the argument together in a meaningful way. This is why I share these scripts, so that others can derive their own recording scripts from it. If You find any bugs or if You feel like a great feature is missing, be a hero and issue a pull-request.
